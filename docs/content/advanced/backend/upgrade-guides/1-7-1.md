# v1.7.1

Version `1.7.1` of Medusa introduces the `JobSchedulerService` which changes how scheduled/cron jobs are created.

## Overview

Version `1.7.1` of Medusa introduces a new service `JobSchedulerService` that handles all logic and functionality related to created scheduled (previously named cron jobs).

With this introduction, the previous use of `EventBus` to create a cron job has been deprecated of using the `JobSchedulerService`.

## Actions Required

In your loader file that creates a cron job, replace the use of `eventBus` to `jobSchedulerService`:

```ts
const myJob = async (container, options) => {
  const jobSchedulerService = container.resolve("jobSchedulerService");
  jobSchedulerService.create("my-job", {}, "0 0 * * *", async () => {
    //...
  })
}
```

You can learn more in the “How to Create a Scheduled Job” documentation.
